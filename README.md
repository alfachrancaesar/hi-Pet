# HI!PET APP
(Product Briefs)

**Global Description** <br>
      HI!PET is an Android based application intended for pet owners and people who are interested in raising pets. The app itself focused on two main actors, which are the pet owner and the pet stores. HI!PET allows the user to order all kinds of pet raising kits, pet services (such as grooming and breeding), and even displaying the nearest pet clinics for every pet category (ex: primate, poultry, reptile, etc.). HI!PET also provides the users with couriers to deliver all the pet matters, including the pet itself. 

**Necessity Assessment** <br>
      In the scope of pet ownership, the common problem for the pet owners are usually finding a way to deliver their pets for breeding and grooming, since common couriers do not deliver animals. Other problem might be for some unusual pet owners who pet lizards, primates, etc. in finding the nearest pet clinics on their area. In addition, HI!PET allows the user to order all kinds of pet raising kits. Based on those problems, HI!PET will be created. 

**Values Created** <br>
      The values created from the app are customerâ€™s trust and funds for greater improvements.

**Primary Target Segment** <br>
